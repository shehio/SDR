### Radion Frequency ID (RFID)
RFID cards have a microchip and an antenna to communicate with the readers. They follow different protocols that allow or do not allow encryption and handshake.

#### Standard Proximity Cards [125 KHz]
Outdated cards that don't have any encryption.

#### Contactless Smart Cards [13.56 MHz]
Like [MIFARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE) DESFire EV1 and EV2, which use AES 128 encryption, and NFC (Near Field Communication), they're more secure but have a smaller read distance.
